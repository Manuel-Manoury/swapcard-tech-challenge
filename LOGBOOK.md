Test subject received. The subject seems quite simple, but there is a lot I'm not yet familiar with (SSR -> Next.js, GraphQL, Netlify). I think I'll go with the bolder approach and maximize the amount of unknown tools/lib I use for this test. It's a gamble, but I want to showcase that I can be flexible and learn fast, rather than proposing something strictly from my comfort zone.
I read a bit to refresh my memories of previous articles about GraphQL, Next.JS and Netlify. 
Using the heroku app provided in the subject, I play a bit with the API, to see the amount of data I'll be able to use and start thinking about a UI. I'd like to make some kind of Spotify-inspired UI with a bit of a neumorphism or glassmorphism twist to it, as I never implemented such UIs and I think they look nice. Let's stick with the additional challenge of stepping out of my comfort zone, why not using Tailwind as a CSS framework, and rely more heavily on CSS grids.

I play some more with the GraphQL API, to see if the ideas I got during the day can be implemented. I'm a bit sad, the API does not seem to offer a stable image source for `artists` as it relies on external sources for media. Also, there does not seem to have a way to fetch random `artists` from the API, which compromise my original idea for the homepage. I start to wonder what my UI will look like, and if and how I will be able to showcase my UI/UX sensitivity.
I'm diving in the technical part, as my time is precious and I still have a lot to discover. First, let's setup a Next.js project that deploys on Netlify.
After a few minutes, I get a running Next.js app, they hold their promises : that's fast, all of the boilerplate is taken out from the more "classical" React app (even with Typescript support).
A few minutes later, after a first failed attempt, I get my Next.js app running on Netlify. Now I have a major issue, my naive routing approach relies on slugs in the URL, which depends on the API response. There's no way I will load all the possible `artist` IDs to generate the possible route options. Maybe my routing approach was too naive and I will need to change it. Let's dig into Next.js a bit deeper to see how to handle dynamic routing and deploys to Netlify, while keeping SSR in mind.
After some time watching videos, I found my answer https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/nextjs/nextjs-ssr-non. These videos are nice, short, step by step, and well structured. From what I understood, I get rid of the unnecessary code / config from my earlier attempts to have dynamic routes + SSR + netlify URL handling, I had the `getStaticPaths` method with `fallback: true` and see where it goes.
